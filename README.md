# Branch
For the Empower Hackathon!

# Project Overview
Branch (at least this version of Branch) is simply a shell of the app that has a disconnected database. Branch (in the future, hopefully) will be an app where mentors and students can connect with each other with ease through filters, geographical mapping, and search.

# Setup
The folder provided holds the source code for both the Xamarin and the C#. You can run branch by running it through either an Android or an IOS emulator. I ran it through Visual Studio 2022, with a project that specifically had Android and IOS compatability which can be selected in the project presets.

# Usage Instructions
Run the app and click around. That's about it for now. :D
